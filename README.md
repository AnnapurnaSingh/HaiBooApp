HaiBoo!!!
[A hybrid haiku / for you / to send / to your boo(s)!]

Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could randomly combine 3 different lines from 3 different Haikus to make a Frankenstein hybrid Haiku?

Have you ever wanted to text a haiku to your boo(s) without having to actually write one?

Let's face it: who hasn't?!?

I have finally addressed these two most pressing of humanity's needs with my paradigm-shifting app:

HaiBoo!!!

Now you can say "Hai, Boo!" with a hybrid Haiku (aka HaiBoo! - Thank you, Cap'n Obvi).

HaiBoo is the more poetic alternative to droning monosyllabic "yo," "yo," "yo"s at your most cherished boo(s), or just your boo(s) du jour.

Also keep in mind that perfect strangers almost always appreciate poetry spamming via text!

On the welcome page of my HaiBoo Maker, you are greeted with a pre-made HaiBoo just for you.

You can keep making new HaiBoos by hitting the convenient button, or if you like the one on the screen, you can enter your boo(s) phone number to have it texted to them!

Don't worry, HaiBoo won't retain their phone numbers or auto-spam/stalk them. Those features are for versions 2 and 3, respectively.

If you like hybrid HaiBoos, but have a craving for the real thing, click on the link at the bottom of the HaiBoo Maker page to take you to all the original Haikus. All of these haikus are sourced from the awesome HaikuJournal.org. (Visit them and contribute a Haiku yourself!)

If you like a particular haiku enough to want to contemplate it on its own page, just click on it to see something like so:

And that's about it for now - Start HaiBooing stat!
Time is a-wasting and your boos won't Hai themselves.

Oh, and my app utilizes Ruby on Rails, Nokogiri, jQuery, Ajax, and Bootstrap and Nexmo. Not liable for any reactions / rejections from your boos.


On a completely unrelated but thematically consistent note:
